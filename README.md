**An open-source initiative to archive and verify corporate terms of service, ensuring companies can't silently rewrite history.**

## üéØ The Problem

Every day, companies update their terms of service, privacy policies, and user agreements‚Äîoften without notice. These changes can dramatically affect user rights, data ownership, and legal recourse. When disputes arise, users have no way to prove what terms they originally agreed to.

**Veritas changes that.**

## üõ°Ô∏è Our Mission

We're building a decentralized, tamper-proof archive of corporate legal documents using IPFS technology. Every archived document receives an immutable cryptographic hash‚Äîa digital fingerprint that proves exactly what a company's terms said at any point in time.

Think of it as a time machine for terms of service, powered by the community, for the community.

## ‚ú® Why This Matters

- **Consumer Protection**: Users can prove what terms they agreed to when they signed up
- **Corporate Accountability**: Companies can't gaslight users about "what the terms always said"
- **Legal Evidence**: Provide courts with verifiable historical records of agreements
- **Research Resource**: Enable journalists and researchers to track how tech policies evolve
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Help regulators monitor compliance with consent decrees and settlements
